Inspired by the research in Armin Hofmann's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.typogabor.com/armin-hofmann/pages/11-armin-hofmann.html">Graphic Design Manual</a>, I began my own grid study by mixing graphic design & code. The drawing device is made of a grid of circles and it records the wandering paths inside the grid to create shapes. Each journey is a closed loop and never visit a circle more than once. The demo below shows variants of circle size, stroke width and outline/filled mode.

With the drawing device setup, I started exploring compositions, densities, shades and dimension by layering the paths in interesting ways.

After the complex grid exploration, I was drawn to the individual fluid shape created with smaller grid. They feel like different characters each has its own gesture and disposition. Below are 3 collection of shapes made with different circle sizes.

I developed a series of sketches by playing with colors and the 3x5 grid system. Naturally these are perfect for riso, I tried to explore texutres and gradients with these risograph prints in tabloid size.

The grid study also lead to the creation of MAX â€“ an experimental typeface made in javascript, featuring 4 axes of variants including width, weight, slant and curve. Checkout the type specimen: <a href="https://yuinchien.com/projects/max" target="_blank">yuinchien.com/projects/max</a>. Here is a series of plotter drawings featuring MAX to showcase the breadth of variable fonts.
