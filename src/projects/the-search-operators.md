How would an interface with its own consciousness, senses, and gestures reverse the passive role of user in Interaction Design? "The Search Operators" is the sloppy twin of Google search. By reversing the passive roles of UI elements, I want to expand the traditional notion of user interfaces. The Search Operators opens up a narrative space inhabited by three sloppy Google operators - Jarek, Remo, and the yawning Surina - which allows people to speculate upon an emotional reality within technology. By anthropomorphizing interface elements using the latest web technology such as HTML5 and CSS3 transform, I have composed narrative spaces within interactions.

My remixing experiments introduce a playful aesthetic to familiar interfaces, which afford open reflections and interpretations. Remix Interactions are mash-ups of hacked web technology and humanistic expressions: a radical response to patterns of interface design which predicts human behavior. The work aims to provide room for people to speculate about human condition in the digital age.
